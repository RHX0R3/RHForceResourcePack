# RaidersHeaven.eu -- Force Resourcepack
#    - Minecraft plugin -

# Configurable forced resourcepack for your server ☄️ Perfect to prevent XRAY resourcepacks!

# Set the resourcepack url for direct download. I recommend using https://mc-packs.net/
# Check the size of your resourcepack beforehand! See the following table:
# > 1.18 | 250 MiB
# < 1.18 | 100 MiB (≈ 100.8 MB)
# < 1.15 | 50 MiB (≈ 50.4 MB)
# Note that download success or failure is logged by the client, and not by the server.
